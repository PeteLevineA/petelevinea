### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on tech remote inclusion at https://remoteinclusive.com `coming soon`
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™ve written the front-end of https://parodycinematicuniverse.com
- ðŸ¤” One of my favorite hobbies is collecting domains and building side projects that I never finish
- ðŸ‘¯ My favorite project `so far` was working with assistive technology at Craig Hospital! https://craighospital.org/services/assistive-technology
- ðŸ’¬ I absolutely love all things front-end, happy to help fumble through the nuances of JS and CSS with you!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am Native American and Caucasian. I was the vice president of the Native American Student Association at RIT `NASA!`
