### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I've developed and launched https://remoteinclusive.com
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently converting the above from gatsbyjs to next.js
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning computer vision. Bought three thinkstations with xeon processors and quadros. They're setup with high availibity using Microk8s and ubuntu 22.04
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™ve written the front-end of https://parodycinematicuniverse.com
- ðŸ¤” One of my favorite hobbies is collecting domains and building side projects that I never finish. See above
- ðŸ‘¯ My favorite project `so far` was working with assistive technology at Craig Hospital! https://craighospital.org/services/assistive-technology
- ðŸ’¬ I absolutely love all things front-end, happy to help fumble through the nuances of JS and CSS with you!
